# General principles
1. Everytime you finished the work, You MUST make sure the modificiation does not break the build.
2. When you finished a complex task or a multiple steps mission (especially in YOLO mode or auto-accept edit), remember using /sendNotification tool to notify me when the job is done! Usage:  /sendNotification --channel=line --message "Mission Completed: [description]"
